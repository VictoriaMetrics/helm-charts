## Quick start

This Helm chart deploys a log collection agent as a DaemonSet.
It collects logs from all containers in a Kubernetes cluster and forwards them to the configured VictoriaLogs destinations.
If more than one destination is specified, then the collected logs are replicated among the configured destinations.

This chart will expand its functionality as the corresponding features are added to [vlagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vlagent/).

- To quickly install single-node version of VictoriaLogs and `victoria-logs-collector`, see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-single/#quick-start).
- To start with a VictoriaLogs cluster and `victoria-logs-collector`, see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-cluster/#quick-start).

## Chart configuration

The simplest working configuration includes specifying the `remoteWrite` array and setting CPU and memory resources for the chart.

Example of a minimal working configuration:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```

If multiple `remoteWrite` entries are defined, logs are replicated to all the specified destinations.

See [victoria-logs-single](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-single/#how-to-install) and [victoria-logs-cluster](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-cluster/#how-to-install) documentation for details how to determine remote write URL for each installation type.

### Basic auth

If you need to use basic auth, define the secrets via environment variables as shown below:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428

env:
  - name: VL_remoteWrite_basicAuth_password
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: auth-secret
        key: VL_PASSWORD
  - name: VL_remoteWrite_basicAuth_username
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: auth-secret
        key: VL_USERNAME
```

### Multitenancy

To define [tenant](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy), set `ProjectID` and `AccountID` headers as shown below:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://localhost:9428
    headers:
      ProjectID: 12
      AccountID: 42
```

### TLS

To enable TLS verification for the remoteWrite target, you can specify the `tls`-prefixed params inside each remoteWrite entry.

At a minimum, you should provide the `tlsCAFile` path so that the collector can verify the server's TLS certificate.
This is useful when the target endpoint uses a certificate signed by a custom or self-signed Certificate Authority (CA).

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: https://victoria-logs:9428
    tlsCAFile: /etc/tls/ca.crt

extraVolumes:
  - name: tls-certs
    secret:
      secretName: tls-secret

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: tls-certs
    mountPath: /etc/tls
    readOnly: true
```

If you want to disable TLS certificate verification (not recommended in production), you can set `tlsInsecureSkipVerify` to true.

This will skip verification of the server's certificate and allow connecting to targets with self-signed or invalid certificates.

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: https://victoria-logs:9428
    tlsInsecureSkipVerify: true
```

### Ignore fields

VictoriaLogs efficiently compresses repeated values, such as pod and node labels.
However, if you prefer not to store certain fields, you can ignore them using the `VL-Ignore-Fields` header.
For example:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428
    headers:
      VL-Ignore-Fields:
        - file
        - kubernetes.container_id
        - kubernetes.pod_annotations*
        - kubernetes.node_labels*
        - kubernetes.namespace_labels*
        - kubernetes.pod_labels*
```

This allows you to exclude unnecessary or sensitive fields from being ingested.
If sensitive data has already been ingested, see how to
[exclude logs from search result](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#access-control-inside-a-single-tenant).

### Extra fields

You can add custom fields to your logs by setting the `VL-Extra-Fields` header in your configuration.
For example:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428/
    headers:
      VL-Extra-Fields:
        zone: us-east1-c
        source: victoria-logs-collector
```

This feature lets you attach metadata to every log entry,
making it easier to filter, group, or analyze logs based on these additional attributes.
