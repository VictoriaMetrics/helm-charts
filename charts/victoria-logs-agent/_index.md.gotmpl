## Quick start

This Helm chart deploys the log receiver agent as a StatefulSet or Deployment (configurable via values in the chart).
It receives logs using [supported protocols](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/)
(for example: syslog, Elasticsearch, OpenTelemetry) from cluster workloads and forwards them to the configured VictoriaLogs destinations.
If more than one destination is specified, collected logs are replicated to all configured destinations.

- To quickly install single-node version of VictoriaLogs and `victoria-logs-agent`, see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-single/#quick-start).
- To start with a VictoriaLogs cluster and `victoria-logs-agent`, see [these docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/helm/victoria-logs-cluster/#quick-start).

## Chart configuration

The simplest working configuration includes specifying the `remoteWrite` array and setting CPU and memory resources for the chart.

Example of a minimal working configuration:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```

If multiple `remoteWrite` entries are defined, logs are replicated to all the specified destinations.

### Basic auth

If you need to use basic auth, define the secrets via environment variables and fill out the `basicAuth` object as shown below:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428
    basicAuth:
      passwordEnvKey: 'VL_PASSWORD'
      usernameEnvKey: 'VL_USERNAME'

env:
  - name: VL_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: auth-secret
        key: VL_PASSWORD
  - name: VL_USERNAME
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: auth-secret
        key: VL_USERNAME
```

### Multitenancy

To define [tenant](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#multitenancy), use `projectID` and `accountID` as shown below:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://localhost:9428
    projectID: 12
    accountID: 42
```

### TLS

To enable TLS verification for the remoteWrite target, you can specify the `tls` block inside each remoteWrite entry.

At a minimum, you should provide the `caFile` path so that the agent can verify the server's TLS certificate.
This is useful when the target endpoint uses a certificate signed by a custom or self-signed Certificate Authority (CA).

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: https://victoria-logs:9428
    tls:
      caFile: "/etc/tls/ca.crt"

extraVolumes:
  - name: tls-certs
    secret:
      secretName: tls-secret

extraVolumeMounts:
  - name: tls-certs
    mountPath: /etc/tls
    readOnly: true
```

If you want to disable TLS certificate verification (not recommended in production), you can set `insecureSkipVerify` to true.

This will skip verification of the server's certificate and allow connecting to targets with self-signed or invalid certificates.

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: https://victoria-logs:9428
    tls:
      insecureSkipVerify: true
```

### Ignore fields

VictoriaLogs efficiently compresses repeated values, such as pod and node labels.
However, if you prefer not to store certain fields, you can ignore them using the `ignoreFields` option.
For example:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428
    ignoreFields:
      - file
      - kubernetes.container_id
      - kubernetes.pod_annotations*
      - kubernetes.node_labels*
      - kubernetes.namespace_labels*
      - kubernetes.pod_labels*
```

This allows you to exclude unnecessary or sensitive fields from being ingested.
If sensitive data has already been ingested, see how to
[exclude logs from search result](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/security-and-lb/#access-control-inside-a-single-tenant).

### Extra fields

You can add custom fields to your logs by including the `extraFields` section in your configuration.
For example:

```yaml
remoteWrite:
  - url: http://victoria-logs:9428/
    extraFields:
      zone: us-east1-c
      source: victoria-logs-agent
```

This feature lets you attach metadata to every log entry,
making it easier to filter, group, or analyze logs based on these additional attributes.

## Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the chart and their default values.

Change the values according to the need of the environment in ``victoria-logs-agent/values.yaml`` file.
