      Instance {{`{{`}} $labels.instance {{`}}`}} ({{`{{`}} $labels.job {{`}}`}}) is failing to serve read queries during last 15m.
      Concurrency limit `-search.maxConcurrentRequests` was reached on this instance and extra queries were
      put into the queue for `-search.maxQueueDuration` interval. But even after waiting in the queue these queries weren't served.
      This happens if instance is overloaded with the current workload, or datasource is too slow to respond.
      Possible solutions are the following:
      * reduce the query load;
      * increase compute resources or number of replicas;
      * adjust limits `-search.maxConcurrentRequests` and `-search.maxQueueDuration`.
