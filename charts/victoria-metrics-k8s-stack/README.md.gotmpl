# How to install

Access a Kubernetes cluster.

Add a chart helm repository with follow commands:

```console
helm repo add vm https://victoriametrics.github.io/helm-charts/

helm repo update
```

List versions of ``vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack`` chart available to installation:

##### for helm v3

```console
helm search repo vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack -l
```

Export default values of ``victoria-metrics-k8s-stack`` chart to file ``values.yaml``:

```console
helm show values vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack > values.yaml
```

Change the values according to the need of the environment in ``values.yaml`` file.

Test the installation with command:

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack -f values.yaml -n NAMESPACE --debug --dry-run
```

Install chart with command:

##### for helm v3

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] vm/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack -f values.yaml -n NAMESPACE
```

Get the pods lists by running this commands:

```console
kubectl get pods -A | grep 'victoria-metrics'
```

# How to uninstall

Remove application with command.

```console
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME] -n NAMESPACE
```
This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

CRDs created by this chart are not removed by default and should be manually cleaned up:

```console
kubectl get crd | grep victoriametrics.com | awk '{print $1 }' | xargs -i kubectl delete crd {}
```



# Documentation of Helm Chart

Install ``helm-docs`` following the instructions on this [tutorial](../../REQUIREMENTS.md).

Generate docs with ``helm-docs`` command.

```bash
cd charts/victoria-metrics-k8s-stack

helm-docs
```

The markdown generation is entirely go template driven. The tool parses metadata from charts and generates a number of sub-templates that can be referenced in a template file (by default ``README.md.gotmpl``). If no template file is provided, the tool has a default internal template that will generate a reasonably formatted README.

# Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the chart and their default values.

Change the values according to the need of the environment in ``victoria-metrics-k8s-stack/values.yaml`` file.
